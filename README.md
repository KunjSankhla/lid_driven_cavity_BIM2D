# lid_drive_cavity_BIM2D
Code that solves for velocity boundary condition for 2D using boundary integral method in stokes flow.


Currently the code is set to work for lid driven cavity condition.

The code was developed for a General velocity boundary condition, but due to some minor bugs that i am still working to fix, it Gives abrupt results for a few conditions.

I have listed some of the working boundary conditions that can be tested ahead
the inputs for other boundary conditions need to be added into the into Inputs_Grids.mlx.
